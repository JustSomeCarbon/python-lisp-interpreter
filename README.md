This is a simple LISP interpreter written in Python

The interpreter was written as a required project for a class, and as such, was written in a smaller timeframe.
I have posted this project as an archive, so that I may recreate the project at a later date.
The following is the currently working functionality of the interpreter.  


Arithmetic:
- [X] addition, +
- [X] subtraction, -
- [X] multiplication, *
- [X] division, /

Logic:
- [X] greater than, >
- [X] less than, <
- [X] equal to, =
- [X] not equal to, !=
- [X] AND
- [X] OR
- [X] NOT

functions:
- [X] if conditional
- [X] car
- [X] cdr
- [X] cons
- [X] sqrt
- [X] pow
- [ ] defun
- [X] !set
- [X] define

Functionality:  
Variable definition is ready.  
Variable referencing within more complex expressions is ready  

TODO::  
Rectreate the project:
- [ ] re-write expression parser
- [ ] restructure how expression evaluation is cunducted (separate function calls from definitions)
- [ ] integrate function definitions within the interpreter
